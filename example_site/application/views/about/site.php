  <p>The phrase pretty cool guy, as we know it, was a quote by some retard on /b/ in late 2007 describing his personal approval of Master Chief. It started as a shit post on a Friday night. By Saturday morning, Anonymous had cuntpasted it for great justice. Unlike everything else that comes from 4chan it actually enjoys success as a pretty cool meme. Each Image board has also adopted it as their own and tweaked it to its liking. But, of course, like all good things that manage to find their way onto /b/ this meme has been raped to a great extent making the joke old shortly after its inception.</p>

  <p>Japan's chief cabinet secretary Yukio Edano told reporters that two of three men working together in the damaged Number 3 reactor's turbine building slipped into water and did not realize they had been exposed to high levels of radiation until they noticed a rash on their skin.</p>
